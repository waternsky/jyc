# JSON-YAML Converter

Tool to quickly covert json to yaml and vice-versa.
Some people (usually web-dev), who are unfamiliar with yaml,
find json easier to read than yaml. (Personally, i prefer yaml).

# Usage

```shell
./main.py
```
Open [link](http://localhost:7860) after running main application.
Paste your json or yaml for conversion.
